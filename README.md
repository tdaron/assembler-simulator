# Simple 16-bit Assembler Simulator

A simple assembler simulator for educational purposes, designed to help users understand the basics of assembly language and CPU instruction execution.

## Try it online
You can try the simulator online at [Assembler Simulator](http://asm.info.ucl.ac.be/).

## Features
This project implements simplified version of assembly language and CPU simulation on a 16-bit architecture. The details of the instruction set can be found [here](http://asm.info.ucl.ac.be/instruction-set.html).

The simulator includes the following features:
- Parse and execute basic assembly instructions
- Step-by-step simulation of instruction execution
- Visualize registers and memory state
- User-friendly interface for loading and editing assembly code
- Small screen mapped to memory to visualize the output

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests for improvements.

## Acknowledgements
This project is based on the original work by Marco Schweighauser, which can be found at [Marco's Blog](https://www.mschweighauser.com/make-your-own-assembler-simulator-in-javascript-part1/).

The new version has been completely rewritten as part of an UCL/INGI Open Week 2025 project by @tdaron, @Piwy-dev and @ernesto.
